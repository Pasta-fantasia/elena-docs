# Elena Framework for cryptocurrencies trading bots

Elena is a set of Python modules that allows you to write trading strategies providing you an exchange abstraction,
standards for logging, metrics and a lot of deployment options.

Elena can be used in a [Raspberry Pi Zero](01_install/pure_python) up to a Kubernetes cluster or an AWS Lambda as Elena
is being [distributed containerized](01_install/docker) or in your Airflow DAGs (coming soon)... and of course into a
Jupyter notebook.
