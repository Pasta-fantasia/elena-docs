# Configuration by example

!!! note "Note:" 
    This is a work in progress. It's a software configuration guide. This Is Not Financial Advice.


This page guides you to an example of parametrization using DCA_Conditional_Buy_LR_with_TrailingStop and TrailingStopLoss.

- DCA_Conditional_Buy_LR_with_TrailingStop to invest some redundant money.
- TrailingStopLoss to protect or trade some already hodl crypto.

Lets supuse you have 1000 USDT and some old BTC and some HNT from your hotspot.
