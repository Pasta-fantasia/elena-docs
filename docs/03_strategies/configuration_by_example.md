# Configuration by example

!!! note "Note:" 
    This is a work in progress. It's a software configuration guide. This Is Not Financial Advice.


This page guides you to an example of parametrization using DCA_Conditional_Buy_LR_with_TrailingStop and TrailingStopLoss.

Lets supuse you have 1000 USDT and some old BTC and some HNT from your hotspot.

You believe in two possible [scenarios](03_strategies/DCA_Conditional_Buy_LR_with_TrailingStop/index.md) for the next year: _Up and Down_ or _Range_.

- DCA_Conditional_Buy_LR_with_TrailingStop to invest the 1000 USDT.
- TrailingStopLoss to protect or trade some already hodl crypto, BTC and HNT.


## TrailingStopLoss for BTC and HNT

All simulations for long term on any symbol give the same result
